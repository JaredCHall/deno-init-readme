## [1.1.3] - 2025-05-07

### Changed
- Refactored test suite to use **pure dependency injection**, removing reliance on global stubs or mocks.
  - All tests now inject `readFileFn`, `writeFileFn`, `logFn`, and `existsFn` directly into `generateReadme()`, improving clarity and test isolation.
  - Verified flows include: `--dry-run`, `--help`, refusal to overwrite without `--force`, and successful forced writes.

### Added
- Introduced `CommandError` in new `errors.ts` module.
  - Thrown in expected failure states such as refusing to overwrite an existing `README.md` without the `--force` flag.
- Exported `ModuleSettings` type for use in external documentation and improved JSR module API clarity.


## [1.1.2] - 2025-05-07

### Changed
- Replaced custom `fileExists()` helper with standard `@std/fs/exists` for improved reliability and edge-case coverage.
- Removed internal error handling logic for file existence checks; trusted Deno Standard Library instead.
- Maintained 100% test coverage across all branches and lines. ðŸŽ¯

## [1.1.1] - 2025-05-06

- Fix README CLI example

## [1.1.0] - 2025-05-06

ðŸ§ª Full Test Coverage + Refactors for Testability

- Achieved **100% branch and line coverage** across the entire project
- Refactored `DocumentMaker` to remove internal state; all methods now accept arguments explicitly
- Moved config parsing and validation logic to `helper.ts`
- Extracted reusable utilities: `makeModuleSettings`, `makeBadges`, `fileExists`, `parseDenoConfig`
- Simplified testing:
  - Eliminated need for brittle `console.error` stubs
  - Replaced `assertThrows` with `assertRejects` for async error paths
  - Directly tested edge cases like missing config fields, fallback reads, and forced writes
- Identified plan to extract pure logic (`generateReadmeMarkdown`) into `core.ts` to isolate formatting logic

This release streamlines testability and sets the foundation for future modular enhancements.
